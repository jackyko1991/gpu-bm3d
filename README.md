# Final Report

## Summary

We implemented the state-of-art image de-noising algorithm, block matching and 3D filtering (BM3D) in CUDA on NVIDIA GPU. We compared the performance of our implementation with OpenCV implementation and also referenced a highly-optimized open source implementation in CUDA and showed a 20% speedup over the latter. We also show that our implementation can be used in real-time video denoising.

## Background

The block matching and 3D filtering (BM3D) algorithm is a novel method for image denoising based on collaborative filtering in transform domain. Since first proposed in 2007, BM3D has been the state-of-the-art until today. The algorithm consists of two steps each of which has three main stages:

1. **Block Matching** For each reference patch, a set of similar patches of the 2D image is grouped into a 3D data array which we call a group.
2. **Collaborative Filtering** A 3D transform is applied to the group to produce a sparse representation in transform domain, and filtered. After that, an inverse transformation is carried out to cast the filtered data back into image domain, which is a 3D array again.
3. **Reconstruct the Image** The patches in each groups are redistributed into their original positions. Each pixel may be updated multiple times at this stage.

The algorithm runs the aforementioned 3-step procedure twice. In the first run, the noisy image is processed with hard thresholding in the sparse transform to produce an estimated image. Then with this image as input, the same procedure is carried out with wiener filter instead of hard thresholding to get wiener coefficient. We then apply the wiener coefficient to the original images. The latter makes the assumption that energy spectrum of the first output is correct, and is more efficient than hard-thresholding.

## Approach

### Block matching
We first divide the entire noisy image into a set of overlapping *reference patches*. This is done in a sliding-window manner, each patch has size of 8x8, with a stride of 3 by default. The last column and row are guaranteed to generate references, even if the dimensions of image may not be divisible by 3. 

For an example 512x512 input, a total of [(512 - 8 + 1)/3]^2 = 28561 *reference patches* are generated.

Every CUDA thread will be given one *reference patch*. Within each thread, a local window of 64 by 64 around the reference patch is searched for *q patches* that are close match to the *reference patch*. The distance metric we use in matching is the L2-distance in pixel space. This is an approximation to the original paper, where a 2D transformation and a hard-thresholding is applied before applying L2-distance in frequency space. It's much simpler in computation and easier for implementation.

A maximum of 8 *q patches* are kept for each *reference patch*. After the matching, a *stack* of *num_ref_patch x max_num_patch_in_group* patches is produced, each row containing the *max_num_patch_in_group* closest *q patches* to the respective *reference patch*.

### FFT

CUDA has very fast FFT library for 1D, 2D and 3D transformation. To use the CUDA FFT transform, we need to create a transformation plan first which involves allocating buffers in the GPU memory and all the initialization. After creating the plan, we can apply the plan on the data and the actual computation is very fast (refer to the running time breakdown graph below). CUDA FFT also supports batch mode which allows us to perform a batch of transformations by calling API once and CUDA will handle the optimization of the kernel lauches behind.

Fast fourier transform is crucial to the BM3D algorithm and we tried different approaches for the transformation. In the original paper and reference implementation, they both separate the 3D transformation into 2D transformation on the patches and 1D transformation across the patches. So we tried this approach first to compare the performance. After the block matching stage, we will have an array of patch indices and also an array to store how many patches in each of the group. We then gather the data from the images according to these indices to form a 3D matrix.

</div> 

The first dimension is the patch width, the second dimension is the patch height and the third dimension is the patch number. 2D FFT will then transform this array into frequency domain. To perform the 1D transform across patches for each patch pixel location, we need to reorganize the array to form a 4D matrix. 


The first dimension is the pixel value across patches in the same group, the second dimension is the patch width, the third dimension is the patch height and the fouth dimension is the group. In this way, the values to be transformed will be continuous in memory. We then apply the 1D transform and also the hard thresholding to filter the data. During the hard thresholding, we need to record number of non-zero values for each group as the coefficient for aggregation stage. So we map each thread to a group fo patches so that each thread will work independently.

After thresholding, we apply the inverse 1D transform on the 4D matrix, which will then be reorganized back into 3D matrix for 2D inverse transform. Finally the aggregation step will put the patches back to the original image.

In this approach, we will initialize two CUFFT transform plans, 2D and 1D. 2D transform will be applied in both steps on the original images. To save the computation time, we decide to precompute the 2D transformation for each patch in the original images. After the precomputation, we just fill up the 3D data matrix based on the block matching result. This actually saves the 2D forward transformation computation time. We still need to perform the inverse transformation. In our experiment the time saving is not significant. One batch of transformation on all the image patches only cost 0.1s. Since CUFFT library is highly optimized. Once the plan is created, the actual computation time is very short and not all pathces are needed to be transformed. Thus it isn't worthwhile to precompute the all the transformation in the initialization. In fact, during the experiment, the number of transformation for precomputing all the patches and the inverse transformation of the group patches are different. In a single API call on one plan is not going to cater two needs. So we have two options. One is to create two plans with two batch size parameter for the two cases, but we found creating a CUFFT plan will need 0.2 seconds which is 20% of the total time. We need to create as few plan as possible. Another option is to fix the batch size, so that we have only one plan and call the API several times to perform all the transformations. However, calling the API multiple times will introduce large overhead by lauching kernels. The overhead will scale linearly by number of patches. Also, if we use 2D and 1D transformation, we need to reorganize the data layout between two transformation which will introduce extra computation time.

To optimize the above problems, we turn to 3D transformation in the CUFFT library. In this approach, we only need one CUFFT transformation plan since the plan configuration is the same. We can set the batch size to the number of groups so that we only need to call the API once to perform all the transformation. Also, we do not need to change the data layout for the transformation. It turns out the execution of 3D transformation is very fast which taks only 0.006 seconds, 1.5% of the total time.

### Aggregate
After the inverse transformation, the aggregation step returns the filtered patches in the stacks back to their original positions. Because there are overlaps in the patch generation, we keep a weight for each pixel and normalize it.

Each CUDA thread is assigned one stack of patches. From the previous step, a weight of *1/num_nonzero_coeff* is calculated for every stack. 
We use two image-sized global buffers, *numerator* and *denominator* for storage of pixel value and normalization factor.
For every pixel *p* in the stack, we use *atomic_add* statement to increment the corresponding *numerator* entry by *weight x p* and *denominator* by *weight*.
After the accumulation is done, a reduction step, consisting of dividing every *numerator* entry by *denominator* entry is applied to normalize the pixel values.

### A different parallelization assignment
We set out to explore a different work assignment approach from the reference open-source implementation.
The *cuda_bm3d* implementation assigns every *reference patch* to a thread block in GPU, where as we assign a single thread a block of patches in both block matching and aggregation.

*block matching time of different job assignment scheme versus number of total reference patches (adjusted by setting the reference patch stride). The matching scaling here is set to be 32 by 32*

The apparent advantage of our parallelization scheme is its simplicity of implementation - we can use a simple for loop inside each thread to loop over all the query patches. However, it's obvious that the reference implementation's per-block assignment is much faster and more robust to increase in the problem size.

One perceived bane of per-thread allocation is that memory access on warp level benefits from blocked access. 
However, our implementation treats each thread separately, resulting in divergent branches that crumple the block matching and aggregation performance.
A thread-level parallelization can also suffer from contention and waste the shared-memory caches which are *much faster than global memory* per-documentatin.

### Running time breakdown

*The bar chart of running time breakdown. Our implementation strips away unnecessary computation time in transformation. Note the difference in parallelization scheme results in difference in block matching and aggregation time*

As detailed in the previous section, the block-matching and aggregation stage performances are doomed due to the per-thread work allocation scheme. However, because we used a 3D transformation in place of two transformations (2D + 1D), we are able to accelerate transformation time by about 8x.

### Video denoising

We also apply our algorithm onto example videos. 
We used OpenCV for decoding video and displaying denoised result.
